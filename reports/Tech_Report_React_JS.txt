Socketio
What is Socket.io?
  Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. 
What is Socket.io doing for us?
  Allows for real-time updating of webpage elements.
  Used to notify the server when posts/comments/likes are made.
How does Socket.io accomplish these tasks?
  When a post is created or liked/commented on, a signal is emitted from
  the client to the server. (socket.emit)
  https://socket.io/docs/client-api/#socket-emit-eventName-%E2%80%A6args-ack
  https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/master/lib/socket.js#L140
  When the server recieves this signal, it broadcasts a signal to all 
  currently connected clients. (socket.on) (socket.emit)
  https://socket.io/docs/server-api/#socket-emit-eventName-%E2%80%A6args-ack
  https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/master/lib/socket.js#L320
  When a client recieves this signal from the server, the data of the element
  that was updated is reloaded on all clients. (socket.on)

What is JQuery?
	JQuery is a JavaScript library that provides a fast and efficient way to use JavaScript. JQuery exposes various APIs that
	allow for easy DOM traversal and manipulation. It makes various JavaScript functionalities easier for us to use.

What is JQuery doing for us?
	JQuery is currently only used for event handling and DOM Manipulation. Whenever a user types in a textbox, it checks whether
	or not the textbox is empty. If it is empty we are going to add a CSS class that tells the user that they cannot post.

How does JQuery accomplish these tasks?
	JQuery attatches an event handler listening for a keyup event. So whenever a user finshes typing a key, we check to
	see if its empty. If it is not empty we will enable the button by adding a CSS class to the DOM button element.

What is React JS?
  React JS is a component based declarative front end library, where each component acts as a class with properties, state and 
  class methods. Each component can manage its own state and be interwoven for a complete, modular UI. React can also be rendered on
  a server with node. 

What is React doing for us?
  React is rendering our front end components, keeping track of their local state and its varying changes over time and taking care
  of our event handling.

How does React accomplish these tasks?
  The React library uses JSX to take HTML templating to the extreme, allowing for creation of custom front end components that look, feel 
  and behave like like html elements. Each react component is an ES6 class has a state, props, a constructor and class methods. The state, 
  which is designed in the constructor for a component, keeps tabs on all of the elements of the component which can change over time, and 
  when the user calls the function setState() from one of their helper functions, React will asynchronously rerender the parts of the page 
  that contain the state being updated. The helper functions can set the state based on user input or API calls.
  https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html
  
  React handles events by taking in the actual handler of a function as opposed to a string that has its name. It also uses something 
  called a SyntheticEvent in most cases React; events cannot return false to prevent default behavior, it must explicitly use a method called 
  preventDefault().

React JS Libraries and depenecy functionality:

    Webpack JS:
    - What is it?
      - Webpack is a bundler that will transform the react jsx code into vanilla js
        and optimize this vanilla js, so it can be rendered properly and as fast as
        possible

    - What does it solve?
      - Webpack doesn't solve a specific problem from class for us, but it creates a 
        viable entry point for our back end to grab from, and allows us to have
        the full functionality of React.

    - How does it do this?
      - Webpack has many dependencies to help it out, but it uses Common JS and Require
        JS to transform the import statements and JSX statements into vanilla js for the
        browser to render.
    - License:
      - Webpack is MIT Licensed. https://webpack.js.org/license/

    React Router DOM:
    - What is it?
      - React Router DOM is a front end routing library for react in order to have react webapps
        that are more than one page.

    - What does it solve?
      - In class, we had to make a relatively complicated structure on the back end that will 
        decide if/when/where to serve data. This library cleans that up by just creating a 
        component to decide what page to render based on the URL path.

    - How does it solve this?
      - React Router DOM does pseudo routing; it doesn't really render new pages. The <Router>
        and the <Switch> component takes in a series of <Route> components, which contain a 
        component to render and a URL path, and then will simply render the element that is inside 
        of the <Route> that matches the path.
        https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route
        https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Router
        https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch
        
        The <Link> component is a more direct version of the <Router> component, and just renders
        exactly the component specified in the <Link> tag.
