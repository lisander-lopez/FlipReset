Mongo Database
	What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
		Mongo allows us to store things in it, to enable data to be persistant across
		different instances of the application.
	How does this technology accomplish what it does?
		Instead of the conventional tables and columns in SQL styled databases.
		Mongo is based on NoSQL, using a document store model. This allows easy
		extraction and insertion with JSON Styled data. Data Objects are stored inside 
		collections in seperate documents. We used the online service MLABS that allow
		us to host the database virtually instead of locally. This allows all the developers
		to work off of one insance of the DB remoteley and have the same data.

		parses all http requests for us.
	How does this technology accomplish what it does?
		It starts by listening on the TCP connection for an HTTP Request and then routes that request
		to the given function depending on the path. It figures this out by parsing the headers to know if it's
