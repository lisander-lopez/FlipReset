What does this tech accomplish for you?
Firebase provides a real-time database and back-end service.
The service provides us an API that allows application 
data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. We're
using this to save our videos to their storage and then pulling them off to be able
to put them on screen for the users.

How this technology accomplishes this?
Authenticate users with their email addresses and passwords.(Next sprint)
The Firebase Authentication SDK provides methods to create and
manage users that use their email addresses and passwords to sign in.

This helps us upload our video files directly to the DB

...and also download them back from firebase storage
